## Plans for the fork

**Summary**: This document determines what I will and will not do, this doesn't guarantee the integration of any specific mods to the list.

**What I MIGHT add:**

 - New Animation or New Animation Replacers
 - Playerhomes
 - Followers
 - NPCs in general
 - Quest (Must be linked to LotD)
 - Armors and Weapons 
 - New City Overhauls
 - Weather mods and ENB selection
 - New Retexture that I prefer

**What I WILL NOT DO (or shouldnt to a certain extent)**

  This first point is the most important one.
  
 - **Make the list heavier, restrict it to higher end pcs as original Lexy's**
 
 - Modify Lights and lighting elements
 - Loot in general
 - Survival Aspects (only improving, never removing)
 - Remove most of Lexy's own list.

## But for now?

  **First steps toward 2.1 are:**
  
 - Adding Play Random Idle with Realistic Animation Project's Idles
 - Some MCM Automation and rework of the MCM page


  Thanks for reading
